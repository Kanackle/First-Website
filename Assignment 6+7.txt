The following assignment was a 2 week/2 part assignment.
For the first week, we were to find a dataset we were interested in.
The dataset I picked was one from many on mtgjson.
From that dataset, I picked out the most important features of a mtg card and displayed those following features for all 121 cards.
Each feature was stored in its own array and then displayed on the page together.
There were some roadblocks I hit, but most of it was smooth sailing.

For the second week, we were to use jquery to much more easily modify the DOM.
Essentially, the dataset we picked from last week was to become more responsive to user input.
I had many ideas of how I wanted to go about this.
Originally, my plan was to sort by artists and then link to the various artist's website so users can see additional works.
Unfortunately, a few of the artists didn't have their own website and linking a site to each card was a lot more tedious and harder than i thought.
So, I planned to change it so that the whole card can just be displayed.
That, also turned out to be a lot harder as I had to utilize the google images API and make sure it found the correct image and displayed that.
In the end, i settled on a simple hover function that would display the card's flavor text, if it had any.
