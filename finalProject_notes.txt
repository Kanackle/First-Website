Idea:
Mount and Blade copy simulator
4 kingdoms
Control one, 3 NPCs
Simulate battles between them
User decides which battles to take and how to go about them

1)
Made rooms object (rooms.js)
Start room, Throne room, War_chambers
Function to change between rooms using directions
home_page.html - Front page for all info on game
info.js - game instructions. to be appended onto front page

2)
Script.js:
Random number generator functions -> Food, Army, Money
4 kingdoms -> 12 random numbers
Use F/A/M as variables in CombatScore function
CombatScore determines strength
4 kingdoms -> 4 strength numbers

3)
Added expedition room to rooms object
User choice to increase amount of food, army or money
4 kingdoms = WAYYYYYYYYY TOO MANY DECISIONS
user only fights one kingdom at a time
What to do about the other two kingdoms
All kingdoms must have 4 dynamic variables regardless of entering a visible battle -> What about expeditions?
Conditional for entering expedition room (changeRoom function applied)

(would it have been easier if i had just made a high school simulator?)

4)
(high school simulator seems just as hard. Side project for the summer perhaps)
Dial it down to 2 kingdoms
Conditionals for entering war_chambers or expeditions
Expeditions need to dynamically change combat score 
War_chambers need to dynamically change combat score
Both sets of variables have to match with one another

5)
Historical weather API included
BADDDDDD mistake adding unloaded array to object loaded onto HTML page
Removes all fixed variables from object and includes them in various appends
Turns out appending things basically makes them dynamically allocated

6)
Simulate a battle -> Elaborate ideas
Simple idea -> Run RNG function to symbolize losses/gains after battle

7)
Added end game function
Break statements in various loops to end game once resource hits 0
