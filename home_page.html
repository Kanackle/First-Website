		<p>Welcome to the land of Hedonia</p>
		<p>A land broken up by two warring kingdoms, each attempting to claim supremecy over the other.</p>
		<p>It is a land which ensures the promise of fortune, glory, and power.<p>
		<p>Great opportunities, and even greater dangers, lie around every corner</p>
		<br>
		<p>One of those kingdoms is the <b> Kingdom of Yiramm </b>.</p>
		<p>They are led by the mighty <b> Queen Hannah, Slayer of a Thousand Men </b>. </p>
		<p>Built on the banks of the Titrate River, farmers make up the backbone of this kingdom.</p>
		<p>Crops from here feed mouths in every corner of Hedonia.</p>
		<p>Although, the army is not large, <b> Queen Hannah </b> can call on her vast civilian militias to bolster her forces.</p>
		<p>What it lacks in physical power, the <b> Kingdom of Yiramm </b> more than makes up for in numbers.</p>
		<br>
		<!--<p>To the west are the Mountains of Jellah </b>.</p>
		<p>They are home to the nomadic tribe, the <b> Hordes of Alaysa </b></p>
		<p>Born in war, she has been bestowed upon with the name, <i> Slayer of a Thousand Men</i></p>
		<p>They are a fierce warrior clan whose numbers vastly outnumber any of the other three kingdoms. </p>
		<br>
		<p>To the north is the <b> Kingdom of Lareal </b>.</p> 
		<p>It is an assortment of small fishing villages.</p>
		<p>Although the kingdom may not by very large, it boasts the best navy of any of the four kingdoms.</p>
		<p>For that reasom, they boast of sizable influence on the waters of Hedonia</p>
		<br>-->
		<p>The other is the <b> Kingdom of Elieveth </b></p>
		<p>Although, by far, the richer of the two kingdoms, hard times have befallen this kingdom.</p>
		<p>A mysterious plague has ran unchecked through the populace and wiped out a quarter of its population.</p>
		<p>Cmpounded with recent losses in battle. the <b> Kingdom of Elieveth </b> is at its lowest point ever.</p> 
		<p>The economy is in shambles, the streets are littered with thieves and brigands patrol the outskirts hoping to catch a helpless merchant.</p>
		<p>You are the ruler of this kingdom. It is your job to restore this fallen kingdom back to its glory days.</p>
		<p>To do so, you must destroy the <b> Kingdom of Yiramm </b> before it destroys you.</p>
