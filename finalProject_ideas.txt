System: How much I tilt while playing video games

Factors: Losing streak
	Feelings of helplessness
	Current mood
	What game it is(singleplayer vs multiplayer)
	If im playing with someone(group vs solo)
	What are my objectives when playing the game?(to have fun or to win)

Control over factors: No control over this; each multiplayer game is won or lost as a team
			No control over this; multiplayer games are specifically designed in a way that a single player can't necessarily "carry" his team to victory
			Some control over this(affected by factors 4,5,6 and itself)
			Full control - I pick which game I want to play and when
			A lot of control, but not necessarily full control - I decide if I want to join a group, however people can deny my request to group up with me/join their group
			Full control - I decide how I wish to play the game

All of these factors are varying degrees of short term effects

Factors affecting each other: Current mood is affected by recent events/people I am grouped with/how serious i wish to take the game
				Typically, I tend to have more fun playing the game if im in a group vs not in a group

Feedback loop: Feelings of helplessness affects my current mood -> not focused on game -> feels helpless to stop losing streak -> current mood affected -> -> ->
